# Aggregate Planning Chatbot

A **Tkinter-based chatbot application** designed to assist with **aggregate production planning** by evaluating forecasted demand, production capacity, inventory levels, workforce size, and other key parameters.

This project includes both a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and **console-based interaction**, allowing users to calculate production shortfalls, identify excess capacity, and receive actionable recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Interactive GUI** for entering forecast data (Tkinter).
* **Console-based chatbot** for detailed step-by-step planning discussions.
* **Dynamic Calculations:**

  * Detects **production shortfalls** and suggests corrective actions.
  * Identifies **excess capacity** and provides recommendations.
* **Alternative Decisions:**

  * Suggests options for **increasing revenue** or **moderating expenses**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** (GUI framework)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AggregatePlanningChatbot.git
cd AggregatePlanningChatbot
```

### **2. Run the application**

```bash
python main.py
```

## 💻 How It Works

1. **GUI Mode:**

   * Launches a Tkinter window where users can input values for:

     * Forecasted Demand
     * Production Capacity
     * Inventory Levels
     * Subcontracting Capacity
     * Workforce Size
     * Part-time Workers

   * After entering values, clicking **Submit** will trigger the chatbot's planning logic.

2. **Console Mode:**

   * The `AggregatePlanningChatbot` class collects inputs from the console.
   * It then evaluates production shortfall or excess capacity and suggests possible actions.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

* Add **data persistence** (save planning results).
* Implement **charts/graphs** for visual planning results.
* Add **AI-based forecasting models** to predict demand automatically.
